# Survey form with React
This week's project was to build a form on react. We used useState-hooks and learnt how to do conditional rendering.

## The problem
This week I became better at asking around and using StackOverflow when I encountered problmen. I tried the solutions provided and was happy to see that it worked. I am proud of myself that I don't push myself to try out things for a long time but instead ask for help sooner.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
